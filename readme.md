# Zend Framework Expressive Composer Installer

This is a proof of concept for a composer installer based on user input.

1. Download this package.
2. Run composer install to install the router.
3. Answer question.
4. The chosen router package should install and the other one should uninstall.

## TODO:
- Test how this works out with packages in require-dev.
- Figure out a way to save the user selection for ``composer update``.
