# Zend Framework Expressive Composer Installer

This is a proof of concept for a composer installer based on user input.

1. Download this package.
2. Run composer update.
3. Answer question.
4. The chosen router package should install and the other one should uninstall.

## TODO:
- Test how this works out with packages in require-dev.
